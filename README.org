#+title: Man Made Emacs

An Emacs =framework= for the new user, or those who are searching for a starting point for their own configuration.

* Goals

Welcome reader.

- Use Emacs build-in packages wherever possible and practicable.
- Use standard package manager =package.el=
- Don't use =use-packe= but the simple and light =setup.el=
- Functionality and features provided by modules
- Modules functional outside of this =framework=
- Decent starting point with useable defaults, good editing and projects
- Fast
